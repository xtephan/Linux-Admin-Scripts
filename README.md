Linux Admin Scripts
----

A bunch of Linux bash scripts I wrote to automate some repetitive tasks under Linux.

Structure
---
- auto-updater  - Updates the software packages and the flash player
- backup-script - Rudimentary backup script
- disk-check-warning - Send you an email when you are close to the 30 times mount disk check.

Usage
---
Works best as cron jobs :).

Notes
---

This code has not been updates since 2012.

Tested last time under Debian Wheezy.
